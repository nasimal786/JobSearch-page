        <h4>Growth mindset</h4>
        <p>
          Tutree tutors use encouraging language to promote Growth Mindset, a
          concept pioneered by Stanford professor and leading motivation
          researcher Carol Dweck, PhD. Growth Mindset is the idea that we grow
          and better ourselves by learning from mistakes, because a positive and
          supportive learning environment helps students do their best.

        <h4>Socratic method</h4>
        <p>
          tutors ask guiding questions so that students take a more active role
          in reaching solutions. Thereâ€™s a misconception that strong teaching is
          someone explaining something at you. We believe a collaborative
          approach rooted in Socratic inquiry is crucial for that long-term
          understanding.
